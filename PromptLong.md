Imagine having a friend who knows all the music, and who gets you. Now say what you need. That’s Prompt Search for AI music discovery. Here’s how to get the most out of this natural language music search solution.

## Quick intro: Why Prompt Search exists

Created by a team with a long history in the music industry and AI, Prompt Search is the result of an ambitious goal: **To make music search fast, intuitive, and accessible to anyone.**

You don’t have to be a musicologist. You don’t need to know which keywords or tags are used by a specific music catalog. You don’t even have to be sure of what you’re looking for. You can find music just by describing bits and pieces of what you’re imagining — and even that can be done in whatever words come naturally to you. A lot more on that below.

## 6 ways to use Prompt Search to discover music

### 1\. Describe a scene — however you like

Prompt Search understands unspoken nuances. No matter how you describe your needs, our audio-first search has mastered the art of picking up what mood you’re trying to capture, and the tracks it suggests elevate your storyline.

Whether you go heavy on atmospheric adjectives or stick to the facts is up to you.

#### Query examples:

* “A field of fallen soldiers”  
* “Fast-paced chase in a heist movie”  
* “The CSI team finds a clue under an abandoned truck”

### 2\. Get specific with music details or industry lingo

With AI audio search, there’s no such thing as overexplaining. Precise instructions produce precise results. So the more you know what you want — or the more musically literate you are — the more you can point Prompt Search in your ideal direction.

Go all out by asking for specifics. If you’re musical, include details pertaining to instruments. If you’re a director, paint the scene to your heart’s desire. Consider it your natural language music search engine. You search for music by simply writing what you need.

#### Query examples:

* “Soft sparse strings with tender piano notes quietly playing over it.”  
* “As the camera pans across a sweeping landscape, the music starts with a gentle melody that evokes a sense of awe… and as the camera continues to explore, the music builds with soaring strings, as if mirroring the natural world…” (*We’re stopping here, but you won’t have to. Go nuts.)*

### 3\. Use & combine pop culture references

Prompt Search recognizes references like artists or film titles. Even if you’re considering an eccentric combination of mainstream hits, it’ll be right there with you. You can mix genres, categories, or entire worlds. If mood-based music search is your thing, we've got you covered.

#### Query examples:

* “Quirky music that would work for Pirates of the Caribbean”  
* “A dramatic track that has the feel of Daft Punk’s Get Lucky”  
* “Busy night at Studio 54”

### 4\. Match music to locations or cultures

Convey the energy of a geographically specific atmosphere, holiday, or occasion even if you’ve never experienced it yourself. And for the documentarians — welcome to your playground.

From straightforward inputs to more distinct scenes, you’ll get results recognized and appreciated by locals, as AIMS Music Prompt Search leverages AI audio analysis.

#### Query examples:

* “Elephants bathing in a Kenyan river”  
* “Early morning crowds at the Taj Mahal”  
* “New Orleans during the first hours of Mardi Gras”

### 5\. Take the traditional audio search route

Prompt Search also works with the approach you’re used to. If you’ve finetuned the keyword game across music catalogs, there’s no need for you to step out of your comfort zone. You can find songs by keywords and metadata too. Feel free to stick to what you know with straightforward inputs; you’ll still be surprised by the wide-ranging results.

#### Query examples:

* “Action score with heavy toms”  
* “Cheerful folk pop”  
* “Bouncy electropop with sassy female vocals”

### 6\. Exclude what you don’t want

You can fill out what you’d like to avoid — like a clichéd tone for a trope that you’re looking to turn on its head — directly in your query. The result is greater accuracy from the get-go, making your search a lot less frustrating.

You might be okay with a bit of melancholy, just not a full-blown tearjerker. Or you’re after some unusual lounge music. No problem.

#### Query examples:

* “Music for a farewell scene that isn’t overly sad”  
* “Cocktail bar background music that isn’t jazz”

## Bonus tip for fast results

[AIMS Prompt Search](https://www.aimsapi.com/products/prompt-search) is built to be flexible enough for a myriad of requests. Our main tip for AI music discovery is: **Don’t overthink.** This tool will know what you mean; it gets associations, recognizes things that exist in the same vicinity, and figures out what helps you. Even if your mind’s a little messy.

No need to waste your time figuring out whether to write “1970,” “1970s,” “70s.” or “seventies.” Remember you can search for music using natural language. Don’t get worked up over calling something “synth pop” or “electro pop.” When it comes to music Prompt Search there's no strict boundaries with terminology, genres, or moods. It’ll catch your drift no matter what.

Just input whatever you want and enjoy.
